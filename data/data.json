A rebellion in Vulcan’s capital throws the country into chaos—but after Frau’s incineration of Vulcan’s king along with thousands of the nation’s soldiers, the Vulcanians band together against Farune anyway. Struck by the truth of the situation, Sheila resolves to change the adorable Frau’s fiendish heart.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the invasion of Eyland hits a snag. But neither Eyland nor the unchecked spread of monster meat consumption is the most formidable foe Mars will face—not as long as the saint, Maria, is around! As Mars struggles to keep his bloodthirsty subordinates in line, he’ll need to have his wits about him if he doesn’t want to get completely entangled in her schemes, too."

Needless to say, the Farunians aren’t happy about it. They’re ready to start a war, but Mars wants to talk things out peacefully, so he decides to pay the Theocracy of Mauve a visit. On a fleet of dragons. So much for keeping a low profile.<br/><br/>As Frau and members of the Hundred cause a violent stir in the Theocracy, Mars meets someone who possesses charm the brutal Farunians lack: the beautiful, elegant, and talented candidate for sainthood, Maria. Mars hopes that by striking an agreement with the church and bringing Maria to Farune as its new bishop, he may finally be able to have peace—even if he still can’t get a decent meal. But an even greater conflict is on the horizon, one that threatens to change Ares forever. Will the overwhelming odds be too much for Mars? And is Maria really all that she seems?"

But suddenly, one of Dorssen’s five vaunted Champions, Carmilla, comes barging into the castle alone, seeking a fight with Mars. Before the Frenzied Princess can reach him, she’s stopped by Yamato, the Hundred’s expert sword instructor—and in the middle of their duel, he has an idea for a better role for Carmilla: becoming Mars’s wife. Naturally, everyone in the Hundred—besides Mars—is in complete agreement, and the stage is gradually set for a no-holds-barred battle between Frau and Carmilla for the position of queen consort.<br/><br/>That isn’t all: other countries are beginning to take note of Farune, and with his subordinates determined to run wild and enact all sorts of outlandish ideas, Mars has his hands full just trying to find a decent bite to eat of something—anything—besides that vile monster meat. Where will he go next on his (completely accidental) rise to becoming the strongest king in existence? Will Mars ever be able to eat what he wants again? And what lies in store for the future of Farune—and the world?"

In order to avoid the deadly poison in nearly all of his meals, he slips out of the castle into the nearby monster-infested forest, where, battling monsters and his own hunger, he has to hunt for his meals in order to stave off starvation. Then, one night, as he’s searching for his next bite of monster meat, a red-haired woman shouldering a greatsword appears before him and says to him, “You have promise. Become my apprentice.” How is he supposed to tell her that this must be some sort of mistake? But there’s a secret that only she knows, and that he’s stumbled upon: eating monsters makes you stronger! With her training and his newfound power, Mars will finally overcome all those pesky assassination attempts. However, that doesn’t end things; no, it’s only the beginning of a nationwide—even continent-spanning—series of wars and plots with him right in the middle!"

With no quest of her own, she’s free to wander wherever the wind takes her, adding a few pages to the story of whomever she meets before setting off on her next adventure. At the end of her travels, the witch takes on an apprentice who will one day begin her own journey. And so the cycle continues, or so the story goes.

Yotsuba Hazama is no exception to that, but she is exceptional in another way: she's somehow managed to become fast friends with both of them! Having the whole school's favorite ship as her two best friends isn't exactly easy, though. Not only does it make everyone treat Yotsuba like a particularly obnoxious third wheel, it makes her feel like one too! Or at least it does, until one day, Yuna asks her out.

And Yotsuba, whose social anxiety never seems to kick in until after she's already messed something up...says yes to both of them, without sparing so much as a single thought for the consequences.

Can Yotsuba navigate the interweaving needs of her friends and girlfriends, the pressures of an oncoming festival, and her own crippling social anxiety to save the day and make everyone happy? Not alone, that’s for sure! Where’s Koganezaki to help when Yotsuba needs her most?! No, really... Where is Koganezaki?"

Her girlfriends approve of the unusual arrangement they’ve settled into, her little sisters begrudgingly acknowledge it, and it seems like life couldn’t get any better...which, of course, means it’s time for a new disaster to shake things up all over again! For all the positive traits Yotsuba can’t bring herself to admit that she has, it’s undeniable that she also has a bad memory. Very bad. So bad that she just might’ve forgotten she had a childhood friend way back whenever, then failed to notice as said childhood friend became a nationally renowned pop idol, all to fulfill a promise she made with Yotsuba...which Yotsuba, of course, also forgot about. Their reunion could only possibly be more awkward if, say, Yotsuba’s old friend asked her for help faking a relationship...but what are the odds of that happening?"

And her girlfriends’ fan club is a ticking time bomb in the background of her school life, but it’s not like that has any chance of causing her problems! And, yes, her little sisters have been treating her with an inexplicable mixture of contempt and suspicion lately, but there’s no way that’ll go anywhere unpleasant! On second thought, let’s start over: Yotsuba Hazama is in way over her head! Her first-ever summer with her new girlfriends is in peril of flunking-induced cancellation, her social standing at school is dangling by a thread, and she can’t even figure out what’s wrong with her relationship with her sisters, but it’s definitely going to be a problem!

Having the whole school's favorite ship as her two best friends isn't exactly easy, though. Not only does it make everyone treat Yotsuba like a particularly obnoxious third wheel, it makes her feel like one too! Or at least it does, until one day, Yuna asks her out. And then Rinka asks her out too! And Yotsuba, whose social anxiety never seems to kick in until after she's already messed something up...says yes to both of them, without sparing so much as a single thought for the consequences. Oops! Now Yotsuba only has one choice: keep her accidental two-timing under wraps and make both of her new girlfriends as happy as she possibly can!"

And try as he might, his bad luck’s about to get worse. A chance encounter soon proves that the biggest threat in the tunnels aren’t monstrous bugs but other humans. Now a gang of cyborg relic thieves have him in their crosshairs, and his fellow hunters may not take his side. With his lines of communication cut off, and forced to fight new enemies and old allies, Akira is outclassed, outgunned, and out of options.

But Akira isn’t the only young hunter in the wastelands, and success might just paint a target on his back. Katsuya, a rookie with the hunter syndicate Druncam, is desperate for recognition, but the veterans around him are more interested in Akira’s feats. Unaware of how much support Akira receives from the ghostly Alpha, Katsuya struggles to outdo his fellow up-and-comer, pushing himself and his friends into ever greater danger in the process. But just when it seems he’s pushed his luck too far, Katsuya has a mysterious encounter of his own. When a major job throws these two young hunters together, Akira must come to grips with Katsuya’s one-sided rivalry while facing down a nest of new and deadly monsters."

And under the guidance of the mysterious Alpha, he continues to acquire superior weapons, skills, and gear. But success has its downsides, and unfamiliar threats are hurtling toward him—both in the desert wastelands and in the city streets. Akira’s deal with aspiring gang leader Sheryl puts him in conflict with the rival bosses eyeing her territory, and it’s going to take more than firepower to navigate the web of schemes and alliances ensnaring the slums. Meanwhile, a massive swarm of monsters bursts out of the ruins, heading straight for Kugamayama City. Rushing to answer the call for help offers Akira a fresh chance for advancement, but the real danger may prove to be his fellow hunters..."

Society and science now struggle to rebuild, rediscovering scraps of knowledge from powerful ancient artifacts that defy comprehension. These relics of the “Old World” can make the fortunes of those who find them—if ancient security systems and rogue bioweapons don’t kill the relic hunters first. Akira, a young street orphan, sets out to become one such hunter to escape his brutal life in the slums. Untrained, malnourished, and poorly armed, Akira would be lucky to make it back from the ruins alive—until an encounter with Alpha, a mysterious, ghostly woman, changes his fate forever. Alpha needs a hunter, and she’s willing to train Akira to get one. Will her support be enough to help a penniless kid from the slums climb to the top of a crushing and merciless world?"
